// An operator is a way to compare or manipulate two
// or more pieces of data

// Math operators
1 + 1
2 - 2
3 * 3
4 / 4
// ** is exponent, or in this case, squaring
5 ** 2
// This is the square root
4 ** .5
// This is the remainder
4 % 3

// Comparison Operators

1 > 0
2 < 3
1 <= 1
1 >= 1
// Why 3 equal signs?
// 1 equal is for variables
// 2 equals is for 
3 === 3

3 !== 3

    // Logical Operators

    &&
    is and ||
    is or!is not

// With && both need to be true
if (x > 10 && x < 20)

    // With || only 1 needs to be true
    if (x.even || x > 2)

        //  With ! the condition needs to be false
        if (!x > 2)

            // Compound operators only work on variables
            // This would not work 1--

            // This works 
            let number2 = 1

// Increment
number2++
// Decrement
number2--

// Change operators also only work with variables
number += 2
// Same as number = number + 2
number -= 2
// Same as number = number - 2
number *= 2
// Same as number = number * 2
number /= 2
// Same as number = number / 2
